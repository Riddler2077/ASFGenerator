How to use:

Create a steam excel file.xlsx and put it next to the program

Enter data from accounts

By default: 1 column - logins, 2 column - passwords, 3 column - trade tokens

You can also set a column with nicknames

If the nicknames are not specified/missing, the username will be considered a nickname.

If you have SDA installed and a mobile authenticator is linked to your accounts, copy the maFiles folder from SDA and place it next to the program

Run the program and follow the prompts in the console window

After the work is completed, all data from the accounts will be located in the config folder

Copy the config folder to the ASF folder
